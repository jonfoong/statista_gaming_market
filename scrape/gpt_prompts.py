1. Identify key trends in the article and determine if they affect the gaming market
2. Omit anything that is not a possible trend in the gaming market

1. Use concise language but liberally include specifics if they are present, rather than summarizing trends generically. If necessary, always choose detail over succinctness.
2. Output should be a bullet list with '-' used as the bullet.
3. Final summary should be no more than 3-4 points long.

Articles were selected from a google search and it is possible that they are irrelevant or contain no text due to unsuccessful scraping. In both these cases, return nothing. Do not hallucinate content that did not appear in the article.
